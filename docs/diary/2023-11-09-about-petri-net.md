A Petri net can be viewed as a generalization of finite state machine.

- By viewing state node as place node;
- And viewing edge as transition node.

A Petri net can also be viewed as a generalization of flowchart.

- By viewing action node as transition node;
- And viewing edge as place node.

Note that, in both case, to view edge as node, will enbale multi edge.
